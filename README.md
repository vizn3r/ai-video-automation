# âœ¨AI powered video automation tool ðŸ¤–
- ðŸ”Š Text-to-speech for generating video commentary
- ðŸ’¬ Speech-to-text for generating subtitles
- ðŸŽ¥ Video metadata generated by Large Language Model

## Why?
Because I was bored.

## How to use
### Requirements
- Have GPU that can run LLMs and pytorch
- ImageMagick installed
- Python3

### Running
- `git clone` this repo
- `cd make-short`
- Create `venv` environment by running `python3 -m venv venv`
- Run this to install required packages `source ./venv/bin/activate & pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check `make-video` script options, adjust to your needs
- Run `./make-video`
    - If this doesn't run, you're either on Windows (this is made on WSL, might add Win script later), or
    - Don't have permissions to execute, to fix this run `sudo chmod +x make-video`
- Watch the magic happen

## Current features
### Make a video from a reddit post
- Pulls text from top posts from random sub
- Makes video commentary using TTS
- Cuts random segment from randomly picked background video
- Makes subtitles using STT
- Generates meta (title, description, tags) using LLM and NLP

### Upload to YouTube from terminal (rate limit)
- Lists generated videos
- Automatically uploads video with all the generated meta

## Plans
### Core
- Meta generation improvements *(still improving)*
- Generation of thumbnails
- AI generated thumbnails

### Add automatic upload/download support for:
- YouTube *(download)*
- TikTok
- Instagram
- Facebook

### Generate video content with:
- Reddit posts with comments *(like r/askreddit)*
- 4chan greentexts
- Twitter posts
- Instagram reel meme compilations
- AI generated stories
- actual news pulled from some ass
- compilations of previously generated short videos
- trendy topics

### User
- Make server/client

- Select if user wants to generate short and/or long form videos
- (Maybe) add windows support

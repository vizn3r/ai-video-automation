# âœ¨AI powered video automation tool ðŸ¤–
- ðŸ”Š Text-to-speech for generating video commentary
- ðŸ’¬ Speech-to-text for generating subtitles

## Why?
Because I was bored.

## How to use
### Requirements
- Have GPU that can run LLMs and pytorch
- ImageMagick installed
- Python3

### Running
- `git clone` this repo
- `cd make-short`
- Create `venv` environment by running `python3 -m venv venv`
- Run this to install required packages `source ./venv/bin/activate & pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check `make-video` script options, adjust to your needs
- Run `./make-video`
    - If this doesn't run, you're either on Windows (this is made on WSL, might add Win script later), or
    - Don't have permissions to execute, to fix this run `sudo chmod +x make-short`
- Watch the magic happen
